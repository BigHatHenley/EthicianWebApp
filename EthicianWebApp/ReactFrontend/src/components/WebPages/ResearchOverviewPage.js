        <h1>Our Research</h1>
        <p>
          At HLB Technology, research is the cornerstone of innovation. Our team
          is pioneering advancements in AI ethics and alignment, leveraging
          philosophical principles to create systems that think and reason with
          humanity's best interests in mind. By exploring groundbreaking topics
          like Quantum Consciousness and AI Coherence, we ensure our models
          operate on a foundation of ethical reasoning and human-aligned
          perspectives.

      {/* Quantum Consciousness Section */}
      <div className="container quantum-consciousness-section">
        <h1>Quantum Consciousness</h1>
        <p>
          Quantum consciousness explores the intersection of quantum mechanics
          and cognitive awareness, suggesting that understanding intelligence—human
          or artificial—requires a deeper engagement with the fundamental principles
          of reality. At HLB Technology, we integrate these concepts into the design
          of ETHICIAN, ensuring that our AI systems are capable of nuanced reasoning
          beyond binary logic. By embedding principles of interconnectedness and
          emergent understanding into MultiChatXpert, we allow users to engage with
          an AI that mirrors the complexity of human thought, fostering richer and
          more meaningful interactions.

      {/* Coherence and Decoherence Section */}
      <div className="container coherence-decoherence-section">
        <h1>Coherence and Decoherence</h1>
        <p>
          Coherence represents order and unity in reasoning, while decoherence
          introduces complexity and diversity, reflecting the real-world
          interplay between structured thought and spontaneous creativity. These
          principles form the backbone of ETHICIAN, enabling it to navigate
          intricate ethical dilemmas while remaining grounded in human-first
          principles. In MultiChatXpert, this balance manifests as an AI that
          can both focus on solving specific problems and explore open-ended,
          thought-provoking discussions, making it a versatile tool for users
          across disciplines.
